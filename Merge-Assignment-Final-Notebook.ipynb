    "This assignment was very intuitive because working with a fantastic group learned a lot about git. Specially I was completely new about git, I learned lot. The whole procress I can memorize now and explain you as create repository, clone it to local, create several branches, add file to that, write information inside the file, add, commit, then checkout to another branch, do the same process as we did in previous branch, then merge from one branch to another branch or main, if conflict arise the solve it with merge tool. I am so happy for that clear understanding the process works."
